# BlazeFace FPGA Acceleration

This project implements a fully quantized and hardware-accelerated version of the BlazeFace neural network on the PYNQ-Z2 FPGA board. It includes model quantization, HLS hardware accelerators, a Vivado block design, C++ inference on the PYNQ, and Python code to drive everything from a PC.
